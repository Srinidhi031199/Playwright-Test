Step-By-Step break down (V8 engine) 
JS --> Scanner --> Parse --> Create AST (Abstact Syntax Tree) --> Interpreter --> Compiler --> Machine Code --> Execute

Step By Step Explaination: 

Step1: Scanner 
The scanner reads your raw JS code character by character and breaks it into tokens. 
EX: const sum = 10 + 20;
Tokens: [const] [sum] [=] [10] [+] [20] [;]

Step2: Parsing (Syntax Analysis)
The Parser takes a tokens amd build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

Step3: Ignition (Interpreter)
It takes an AST and conerrts it into Bytecode

Bytecode: It is smaller than a machine code, uses less memory, and allows startup compared to compiling everything upfront. 

Step4: Execution + Profiling 
As the bytcode runs, V8's internal profiler monitors the code and collects the data.

Step5: Turbofan (Compiler)
It is a optimising compiler. It takes the hot bytecode along with the profiling data and compiles it into a higly optimizes machine code. 

Step6: Deoptimization
Step7: Garbage Collection
