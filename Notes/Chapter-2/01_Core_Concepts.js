// This is a comment in JavaScript. Comments are ignored by the JavaScript engine and are used to explain code or provide additional information.

/* 
This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript. 
It can span multiple lines and is also ignored by the JavaScript engine.

console.log("Hello, World!"); // This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

Source Code: 
Is what we write in our JavaScript files. It is the human-readable version of our code that we create and edit.

Byte Code: 
Is the intermediate representation of our source code that is generated by the JavaScript engine. It is a low-level, optimized version of our code that can be executed by the engine.

JavaScript Engine: 
Is a program that executes JavaScript code. It takes our source code, compiles it into byte code, and then executes it. Examples of JavaScript engines include V8 (used in Chrome) and SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox).

This code cannot be executed directly in a browser or Node.js environment because it is just a comment and a console log statement. However, it serves as an example of how to write comments and print output in JavaScript.
